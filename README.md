# Generation and Application of Organoid Disease Models: 29 October to 3 November 2023

## Course overview

The advent of the organoid technology has allowed us to initiate the derivation of the next-generation of cell models with the ability to efficiently create preclinical cell models from normal tissue, cancer types and diseases where it was once impossible. Organoid models are complex, requiring specific handling and culture conditions. An understanding of these requirements will ensure the best chance of success when researchers begin using these models and utilising them for downstream processing.

The aim of this course is to provide participants with practical experience to generate and culture different organoid models, including organoids derived from endometrium, intestinal, and cancer tissues. Students will also gain experience in various downstream applications of organoids cultures including; imagining, drug screening, and organoid manipulation. This course uses both seminars and hands-on sessions to provide participants with the knowledge and practical experience begin using these models in their own institutes and research projects.
